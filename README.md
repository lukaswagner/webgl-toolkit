### ideas
- add postFrame callback to manage picking in (should be controlled by app and not always done)
- add picking logic to renderer for easier use
- add debugging tools
  - framebuffer views
  - shader editor
  - renderpass list
- standardize tracked/dirty naming and initial values
- move helper functions out of renderer
- apply new renderPass interface style to jitterpass
- add uniform set code to uniforms class for easier access
- fix renderer breaking without camera
- make sure multiple renderers on same page work
